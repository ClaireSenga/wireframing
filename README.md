# Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is a fundamental step in the UI/UX design process. It involves creating simple, low-fidelity sketches or diagrams that represent the structure and functionality of a user interface. Wireframes are essential because they help designers, developers, and stakeholders visualize the layout and flow of a website or application before diving into development.

## Importance of Wireframing
- Clarifies Design: Helps define the layout, navigation, and interaction flow of the user interface.
- Cost-Effective: It's easier and cheaper to make changes in the wireframing phase than later in the development process.
- Improves Collaboration: Facilitates communication between team members, stakeholders, and clients by providing a tangible visual representation.
